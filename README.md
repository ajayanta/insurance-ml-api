# Insurance Premium Risk Prediction API (FastAPI)

This project provides a **REST API** built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) that predicts whether a customer **should pay a High, Medium, or Low annual insurance premium** based on their profile.

It demonstrates how to serve a trained **RandomForest classification model** as a production-ready API.
